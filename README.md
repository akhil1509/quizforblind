Online exam for blind people
The Online-Examination for Blind People is basically an online examination system. It reflects
the justification and objectivity of examination. It helps to release the workload of teachers and
students. The current online examination systems do not allow blind people to appear for the
examination. Hence, the proposed application is designed for the blind people so that they can
appear for examination.
It is also useful for the other handicapped people with upper limb disability. This project work
provides the speech user interface for blind people to interact with the application. The
proposed application will dictate the questions to the candidate with the help of Mozilla’s
Speech Synthesis API. The application will accept the answers from candidates through voice.
The proposed system also allows users (examiners/teachers) to add their questions to conduct
the examination. The questions can be added easily by interface provided. As the proposed
system is online/offline, result generation will be quick.
For developing quiz application HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Mozilla’s
Speech Synthesis API and Google web speech API are used.

After going through the application one might wonder how a blind person would login into the application. Actually Invigilator will help the user to login into the application. Login is just created to track the user activity but user activity is not yet provided in the admin panel.

Dummy accounts:
Admin login: username-quizadmin password-quizadmin
User login: username- quizuser password-quizuser
